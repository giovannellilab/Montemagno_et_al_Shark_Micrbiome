Datasets and R code for the Montemagno et al. paper describing the microbiome diversity associated with two shark species in the Mediterranean Sea.

The repository contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Montemagno_et_al_16SrRNA_analysis.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- Shark_env_dataset.csv (the environmental dataset)

The raw fastq files for the sequencing can be accessed with on the ENA website with the project code [PRJEB60929](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB60929).
